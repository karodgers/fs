### Overview

This project is an ASCII art program implemented in Go. It takes a string as input and outputs a graphic representation of the string using ASCII characters. The output resembles the input string but with ASCII characters.

### Features
- support flags that represent banner files
- Handles input with numbers, letters, spaces and newlines.
- Supports various graphical templates using ASCII characters.
- Written in Go with adherence to good practices.
- Includes test files for unit testing.ï¿¼ 
### Scope and Error Handling
- The program does not handle cases where special characters (ASCII values 0-32) are part of the input string. Instead, it returns an error message.
-Additionally, non-ASCII characters (values greater than 128) are not within the scope of your program, and they also generate an error message when encountered in the inpu
- implemented different error handling messages based on the missing elements in the input: 
the case of [STRING] [BANNER] depending on the missing element

If the [BANNER] is missing, the program displays the following usage message:
```
Usage: go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]
Example: go run . --output=banner.txt something standard
```


Exit Status Zero:

    The program uses exit status zero when the program terminates. This allows us to print custom error messages in the terminal. By doing so, we can easily trace the origin of any errors during debugging.




User-Friendly Experience:

    The approach ensures a user-friendly environment by providing clear instructions on how to proceed.
    The concise and informative error messages guide users toward correct usage.


### Banner Formats

The ASCII banner files included in the project have specific graphical representations formatted in ASCII. Each character has a height of 8 lines, and characters are separated by a newline (\n) character.

The following banner formats are included:
- `shadow`
- `standard`
- `thinkertoy`
-  `matrix`

Additional banner files are applicable so long as they meet the conditions of the available banners i.e each character occupies 8 lines and has a total of 855 lines. 
The user can add their own banner file with a txt extension (if it meets the above requirements) and specify the banner name appriately i.e go run . [string] [banner name] 

### How to Install
Ascii-art-fs requires [go](https://go.dev/dl/)  v 1.22.2 to run

Once go is installed  clone into this repository to do this 

- Open terminal and run
``` sh
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/krodgers/fs
cd ascii-art-fs
```

### Usage
Once you are in the directory,

To run the program, use the following command, on the terminal command line:


```bash
go run . "<your_string>" "banner"
```

For example:

```bash
go run .  "Hello" standard
```
To print ascii art in standard font
```bash
go run . "<your string>" thinkertoy
```
for thinkertoy font. and,
```bash
go run . "<your string>" shadow
```
for shadow font.

### Example Outputs

Here are some example outputs generated by the program:

The standard font
```
$  cat -e banner.txt
```
```
